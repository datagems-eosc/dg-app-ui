# DataGEMS Frontend & Design Overview

This is the central documentation site for the **DataGEMS Frontend** application, which serves as the primary **user interface (UI)** for the entire DataGEMS platform.

The Frontend service acts as the presentation layer, focused on delivering a high-performance, intuitive, and consistent user experience for dataset discovery, management, and AI interaction. It translates complex API structures into clear, manageable workflows for end-users.
